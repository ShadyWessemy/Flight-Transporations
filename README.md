### Project Overview
---
This project aims to analyze the flights transportation between the states in US to gain insights such as: cancellation & delay analysis, monthly or yearly trends flights with each airport and the flow between the states. We choose 2 years as our scope to analyze (2021-2022).

### Data Sources
---
- **Transtats:** Extract the transportation data for a specific month and a specific columns.

### KPI
---
- Quick Overview
   - Total Flights, Distance Travelled, Delay, Cancellation & Diversion percentage.
     
- States & Airport Analysis
   - Transportation flow between states, most frequent airport and connectivity between cities.

- Delays & Cancellation Analysis
  - Cancellation in states with reasons, Top states in delay and delay reason distribution.

- Performance 
  -  Departure & Arrival Delay Analysis.

### Tools 
---
- **Alteryx** - Data Cleaning & Profiling
- **PowerBI** - Creating Dashboards

### Data Cleaning
---
In this phase we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Union each year as we collect the data monthly.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
EDA involved Exploring the transportation data to answer key questions, such as:

- 

### Results 
---
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.
